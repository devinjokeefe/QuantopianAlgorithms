# Quantopian Algorithms

This repository contains algorithms which I wrote on Quantopian, a backend engine for developing and testing scripts for Quantitative Trading. All scripts are written in Python and some contain code and ideas from templates and articles written by Quantopian or others involved in Quantitative Trading.
